### Incident Report

**Summary:**
On October 12, 2023, an incident occurred involving an individual in what appeared to be an indoor setting, primarily seated at a desk. The situation initially presented as non-aggressive with a repetitive call for help. However, as the event progressed, symptoms of potential aggression and a heightened level of distress became apparent with verbal threats of violence captured in the audio transcript.

**Patient Condition:**
- **Vital Signs:** Heart rate is 85 bpm, and oxygen saturation is at 95%, indicating relative stability in vital functions.
- The patient consistently called for help throughout the incident, suggesting a potential medical or psychological crisis requiring immediate attention.
- No physical injuries noted from the provided data, but elevated stress levels implied by both verbal and visual cues.

**Aggression Analysis:**
- Initially, no signs of aggression were detected.
- Progression to gestures such as fist clenching indicated possible aggression, corroborated by an increased aggression level peaking at level 7.
- Despite gestures potentially indicating playfulness, verbal threats ("I'm going to kill you") suggest clear aggression towards end of the event.

**Medical Findings:**
- Repeated call for help signifies potential medical or psychological distress, possibly anxiety or panic attack.
- No specific physical injuries reported, but the mental state of the patient is concerning based on verbal exclamations.
  
**Routing Decisions and Who is Called:**
- Initial request for medical assistance was immediately routed to healthcare professionals: Dr. Patel for possible allergic reactions, Dr. Wong for potential injuries, and Dr. Evans due to the emergency nature of the verbal expressions.
- Security unit A and B were alerted, given the proximity and necessity of quick intervention due to escalating aggression and verbal threats.
- Security presence is recommended to ensure the safety of the patient and others, along with medical personnel to assess and manage the patient’s condition.

**Timeline:**
- **0s-4s:** Non-aggressive behavior observed; individual speaking without distress.
- **6s-12s:** Patient repeatedly calls for help.
- **14s-24s:** Fist clenching observed with increased aggression levels; requests for help persist.
- **29s-30s:** Intensified aggression, verbal threats made.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediate medical evaluation by Dr. Evans and the team for potential psychological or emergency medical conditions.
2. Initiate de-escalation strategy with trained security personnel present to manage potential physical threats.
3. Evaluate the need for potential psychiatric support following the initial medical assessment, given verbal threats.
4. Conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine underlying causes of distress and if additional resources or referrals are necessary. 
5. Consider ongoing monitoring of vital signs and psychological state post-incident to ensure patient stability and well-being.

This incident demonstrates an intersection of medical and security concerns necessitating coordinated response to ensure both safety and health of the individual involved.
