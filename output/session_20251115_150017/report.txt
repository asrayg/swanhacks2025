**Incident Report**

- **Date:** November 15, 2025  
- **Session Start Time:** 03:00 PM  
- **Location:** Unspecified indoor facility with wooden paneling and glass  
- **Patient ID:** Not specified  

**Summary:**  
This incident report summarizes the observations and findings from a monitored session where an individual was observed over a period for potential medical or security incidents. The event was primarily recorded through a combination of video and audio monitoring. Initial observations did not indicate any aggression or immediate medical emergencies. However, subsequent frames suggested possible medical distress, leading to clinician engagement.

**Patient Condition:**  
- **Heart Rate:** 85 bpm  
- **Oxygen Level:** 95%  
- **Height:** 5'10"  
Throughout the observation period, the vitals of the individual remained within normal parameters.

**Aggression Analysis:**  
Throughout the event, there were no signs of aggression. The aggression level was consistently recorded as 0 across all timestamps. The individual maintained a neutral or focused expression, indicative of engagement in a task or activity with no signs of aggression.

**Medical Findings:**  
During initial frames, the individual appeared focused and engaged in tasks, primarily looking down or at a device. As the session progressed, the expression shifted to neutral with elements of potential distress. This was confirmed in frames captured towards the latter part of the session, prompting a medical routing. The session audio transcript did not capture any verbal indicators of distress or medical concern.

**Routing Decisions and Who is Called:**  
The later frames indicated "possible distress," resulting in routing the case to a doctor. Given the absence of an explicit emergency and the stable vital signs, the priority was set for a general medical evaluation. The most accessible doctor according to the medical staffing schedule was `Dr. Lee`, the general practitioner.

**Timeline:**
- **00:00 - 118.465683 seconds:**  
  The individual engaged in tasks without displaying signs of distress or medical emergencies.

- **120.016542 seconds onwards:**  
  Repeated frames detected potential distress, warranting medical attention. The individual maintained neutral expressions, suggesting an underlying issue.

**Recommended Actions:**  
1. **Medical Evaluation:**  
   - Dr. Lee should perform a comprehensive assessment to determine the nature of the distress. Follow-up with specialists if required.
   
2. **Monitoring:**  
   - Continue monitoring the situation via video until Dr. Lee completes their evaluation. Maintain logs of any changes in behavior or condition.
   
3. **Technical Review:**  
   - Address technical issues noted in the audio transcript regarding the difficulty in stopping the program. Ensure clear operational guidelines for ease of use in future monitoring sessions.

4. **Security:**  
   - Although aggression was not observed, units should remain briefed to assist Dr. Lee, should further support be required.

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Maintain detailed logs of the individual's responses during Dr. Lee’s evaluation for further analysis and records.

**Conclusion:**  
The incident primarily involves non-critical medical observations requiring further evaluation by medical personnel. No security intervention needed at present.
