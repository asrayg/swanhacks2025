=== SESSION REPORT ===

**Incident Report**

**Summary:**
The event captures a group of young individuals in a casual setting, likely a classroom or study area. Initial observations describe a neutral and focused demeanor, mostly involving individuals engaged with tasks or holding objects. Gradually, several individuals appear to require medical attention, and some exhibit signs of aggression.

**Aggression Analysis:**
Aggression was detected towards the latter part of the session. Two instances were marked with high aggression levels, where one individual was noted to have clenched fists, indicating a potentially aggressive or confrontational stance. This suggests a possible escalation in tension or conflict towards the end of the timeline.

**Medical Findings:**
The session identifies multiple medical alerts, beginning around the midpoint. A recurring theme involves individuals indicating discomfort or distress, with the subsequent recommendation to call for medical help. Symptoms included looking downward, holding the face, or indicating contemplation and possible distress, culminating in multiple calls for medical intervention.

**Timeline:**
- **0-10 seconds:** Neutral behavior with individuals focused on tasks.
- **12-16 seconds:** Initial medical alerts with requests for medical help.
- **21-44 seconds:** Continued medical alerts with increasing signs of distress.
- **45-48 seconds:** Aggression detected, marked by clenched fists and possible confrontation.
- **51 seconds onward:** Continued medical concerns with contemplative and distressed behaviors.

**Recommended Actions:**

2. Conduct a de-escalation intervention for the individual exhibiting aggression.
3. Engage a counselor or mental health professional to address any underlying psychological distress.
4. Ensure all individuals have access to adequate support resources following the incident.

**Routing Notes:**
- Urgent routing to medical units is recommended due to multiple calls for help and identified medical issues.
